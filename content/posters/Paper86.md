#### Abstract

Sequence Alignment is the essential tactic in bioinformatics, as many individual tools have been built, but less in R. Here, we developed one R package SAlignR to perform Sequence analysis such as multiple sequence alignment, motif discovery, seqlogo and visualization. We integrated almost multiple sequence alignment algorithm like ClustalW, MUSCLE and T-Coffee both for nucleotide and amino acid sequence. Moreover, the package provides powerful plotting function for visualization with flexible and customizable setting. This package will provide one alternative to extend bioinformatic pipelines.

**Keywords:** Sequence alignment
