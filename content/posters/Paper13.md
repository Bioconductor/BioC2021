#### Abstract

The aim of the R for Mass Spectrometry initiative is to provide efficient, thoroughly documented, tested, flexible and interoperable R software for the analysis and interpretation of high throughput mass spectrometry assays, including proteomics and metabolomics experiments. The project formalises the longtime collaborative efforts of the core members under the R for Mass Spectrometry organisation to facilitate dissemination and accessibility of their work and gather contributions from the wider community.
