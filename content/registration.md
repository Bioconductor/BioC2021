The registration fee includes access to the virtual platform for the conference, talks, workshops, Q&As following each session, network opportunities. This fee helps us cover the cost of the platform and other associated costs for the conference.

If you are currently experiencing financial hardship or reduced funding, please apply for a BioC2021 Scholarship for a waiver on the registration fee (open soon).
