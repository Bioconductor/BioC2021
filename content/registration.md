## FAQ

- What if I am in a different time zone?
    - We are curating a schedule that will accommodate most time zones throughout the world, but we cannot guarantee that the session you want to attend will be at a convenient time for you. However, all sessions are recorded and will be available for viewing roughly two hours after the session takes place. 

- Are there group discounts?
    - We do not offer group discounts.

- Can I register multiple people at the same time?
    - At this time each person has to register individually. 

- I cannot afford the registration fee. What are my options?
    - You can apply for a scholarship [HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOE8FfcewYccR37o5dtC_tUjTCE5cKbyVMC_68uMuC3CgQbA/viewform?usp=pp_url), and we will consider those cases for a waived fee admission. 

## Cancellation Policy

Bioconductor is a non-profit organization, and conferences are designed only to break even every year. As a result we are generally unable to offer individual refunds.
