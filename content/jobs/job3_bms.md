#### Description

At Bristol Myers Squibb, we are inspired by a single vision – transforming patients’ lives through science. In oncology, hematology, immunology and cardiovascular disease – and one of the most diverse and promising pipelines in the industry – each of our passionate colleagues contribute to innovations that drive meaningful change. We bring a human touch to every treatment we pioneer. Join us and make a difference.

Position Summary

We seek a collaborative and highly innovative computational and systems biology researcher to join our Predictive Sciences team and develop novel computational and screening strategies that originate, elucidate, and prioritize our next-generation targeted protein degradation therapies in both hematological and solid tumor indications. 

Working alongside Research & Early Development colleagues in the BMS Oncogenesis Thematic Research Center, Protein Homeostasis Thematic Center of Excellence, Sequencing Research and other teams in the global Informatics and Predictive Sciences (IPS) department, the successful applicant will play a key scientific role in the systematic profiling and characterization of one of the world’s most advanced degrader compound libraries and in matching novel compound activities to cancer patient states that are challenging to drug using conventional approaches. 

This role offers the opportunity to directly impact the origination and delivery of transformational therapies in key diseases of unmet medical need by innovating and applying leading computational research approaches. Strong interest in the inter-disciplinary application of computational research to empower complex life sciences and therapeutic development objectives is imperative.

Responsibilities 

Integrate multi-dimensional compound profiling data from proteomics, transcriptomics and phenomics screens to elucidate compound activity phenotypes and MoA families.

Prioritize compound MoAs using novel computational strategies to predict their potential therapeutic effects on primary diseases and molecularly-defined patient states. 

Design and implement high throughput genomic assays to profile compound or genetic perturbation effects in model systems that reflect patient state.

Exploration, elucidation, and prioritization of synergistic compound activities.

Collaborate as a member of cross-functional teams and use data to drive decisions in pre-clinical drug discovery research.

Author scientific reports, and present methods, results, and conclusions to publishable standard.

Contribute to planning and execution of collaborative projects with leading academic and commercial research groups worldwide.

 

Background experience & complementary knowledge 

Ph.D. in computational biology, systems biology, bioinformatics, or related field from a recognized higher-education establishment. 

6+ years of post-doctoral experience in applying quantitative inference approaches to elucidate complex human disease biology in university, hospital, pharma, or biotech research environments.

Demonstrated ability to integrate heterogeneous data sources and apply predictive, multivariate research approaches of integrated life sciences datasets.

Proven expertise in the development and implementation of algorithms to distill, analyze and interpret complex compound MoA and/or perturbation datasets.

Experience of computational biology research on a wide variety of molecular and phenotypic profiling platforms, including proteomics, mRNA profiling and high content imaging assays.

Expertise in algorithmic implementation, statistical programming, and data manipulation, using e.g., R/Bioconductor, Python and contemporary, open-source bioinformatics tools and databases. 

Track record of peer-reviewed publications in top-tier scientific journals.

Proven problem-solving skills, collaborative nature, and adaptability across disciplines.

Excellent verbal and written communication skills. Fluent verbal and written English language skills prerequisite.

Around the world, we are passionate about making an impact on the lives of patients with serious diseases. Empowered to apply our individual talents and diverse perspectives in an inclusive culture, our shared values of passion, innovation, urgency, accountability, inclusion and integrity bring out the highest potential of each of our colleagues.

Bristol Myers Squibb recognizes the importance of balance and flexibility in our work environment. We offer a wide variety of competitive benefits, services and programs that provide our employees with the resources to pursue their goals, both at work and in their personal lives.
