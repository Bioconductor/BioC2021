1. Performs computational data analysis of transcriptomics and genomics studies.
2. Designs, develops and implements software tools and analytical procedures supporting
bioinformatics analysis.
3. Participates in projects related to the core sustainability including but not limited to pipeline development, web application development, maintenance of documentation and training guides and other services to support the needs of UAB investigators.
4. Provides computational support services such as study design, data management and data
migration.
5. Offers bioinformatics consultation services to UAB investigators.
6. Evaluates and identifies new technologies for implementation.
7. Performs other duties as assigned.


#### Qualifications	
Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences, Computer Science with interest in Biology/Genomics, or a related field required and six (6) years of related experience required. Work experience may NOT substitute for education requirement. Higher degree levels (masters, Ph.D.) in a related field are accepted as experience.


#### Skills/Abilities/Competencies required:
Knowledge of the biological sciences
Experience in computational biology analysis
Experience in Linux and using a command-line environment
Knowledge of scripting languages such as, Python, shell scripts, and R
Knowledge of best practices of reproducible and scalable research such as version control (git) and environment managing systems (e.g.: conda, Docker, Singularity)
Proficiency in the visualization of omics data
Experience in High Performance Computing environment is preferable
Ability to work as part of a team
Knowledge of theoretical and applied statistics, and molecular biology, as demonstrated through previous work or academic experience
Problem-solving skills
Attentive to detail
Organizational skills
Excellent written and verbal communication skills

An ideal candidate will follow best practices described to ensure reproducible and scalable research and be proficient in the analysis of transcriptomics data (e.g.: differential expression analysis, enrichment analysis, single-cell or nuclei data visualization and analysis, gene set annotation and contribute to upstream data analysis through the development of pipelines). An ideal candidate should also be familiar with managing virtual computational environments and be familiar with high performance computing clusters.

Annual Salary Range: $69,596.80 - $114,150.40
