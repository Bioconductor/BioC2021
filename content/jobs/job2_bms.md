#### Description

Job Responsibilities
At Bristol Myers Squibb, we are inspired by a single vision – transforming patients’ lives through science. In oncology, hematology, immunology and cardiovascular disease – and one of the most diverse and promising pipelines in the industry – each of our passionate colleagues contribute to innovations that drive meaningful change. We bring a human touch to every treatment we pioneer. Join us and make a difference.

Position Summary

We seek a collaborative and highly innovative cancer genomics researcher to join the Predictive Sciences team in San Diego and drive reverse translation efforts that advance next-generation protein degradation therapies in both hematological and solid tumor indications.

Working alongside Research & Early Development colleagues in the BMS Oncogenesis Thematic Research Center, Translational Bioinformatics, Translational Epidemiology and other teams in the global Informatics and Predictive Sciences (IPS) department, the successful applicant will play a key scientific role in stratifying large integrated genomic and clinical patient datasets to identify molecularly-defined patient states and their key drivers as novel cancer therapy targets. Coupled with BMS’ proprietary protein degradation compound libraries, this role offers unprecedented opportunities to study novel disease subtypes, conventionally intractable targets and to directly impact the delivery of transformational therapies in key diseases of unmet medical need. Strong interest in the inter-disciplinary application of computational research methods to life sciences data in pursuit of complex scientific objectives is imperative.

Responsibilities

Design and specify primary patient cohorts in key oncology indications from public, partner and internal sources.

Computationally stratify genomic patient datasets to define both published and de novo patient sub-groups, and classifiers that enable the association of patients and pre-clinical model systems to them.

Apply novel computational research strategies to elucidate potential drivers/therapeutic targets of distinct patient states.

Collaborate in cross-functional teams to propose new targets from patient-centric disease stratification and driver identification efforts and develop pre-clinical validation approaches.

Author scientific reports, and present methods, results and conclusions to publishable standard

Contribute to planning and execution of collaborative projects with leading academic and commercial research groups worldwide.

Background experience & complementary knowledge 

Ph.D. in computational biology, bioinformatics, or related field from a recognized higher-education establishment. 

6+ years of postdoctoral experience in applying quantitative predictive approaches to solve biological problems in university, hospital, pharma, or biotech research environments.

Demonstrated ability to integrate heterogeneous data sources and perform multivariate prediction from integrated high-dimensional datasets.

Experience of computational research on a wide variety of molecular profiling platforms, including transcriptional, mutational, DNA copy number and epigenetic profiling, as well as quantification of other cellular or molecular properties of tumor microenvironment at both bulk and single cell level.

Familiar with a range of cancer genomics consortia, tools, and databases.

Expertise in algorithmic implementation, statistical programming, and data manipulation, using e.g., R/Bioconductor, Python and contemporary, open-source bioinformatics tools and databases. 

Track record of peer-reviewed publications in top-tier scientific journals.

Proven problem-solving skills, collaborative nature, and adaptability across disciplines.

Excellent verbal and written communication skills. Fluent verbal and written English language skills prerequisite.

Around the world, we are passionate about making an impact on the lives of patients with serious diseases. Empowered to apply our individual talents and diverse perspectives in an inclusive culture, our shared values of passion, innovation, urgency, accountability, inclusion and integrity bring out the highest potential of each of our colleagues.

Bristol Myers Squibb recognizes the importance of balance and flexibility in our work environment. We offer a wide variety of competitive benefits, services and programs that provide our employees with the resources to pursue their goals, both at work and in their personal lives.
