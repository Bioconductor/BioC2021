Coding and code review (30%): Code and generally support code and applications on behalf of collaborative project and/or team.
o    Master best practices for project-based code development, QC, and execution consist with the expectations of specific collaborations
o    Perform and manage peer-to-peer code reviews by participating in informal and formal critical code reviews through GitHub
Data Analysis and Application Development (30%): Analyze data of high complexity by applying sound statistical and commonly accepted bioinformatics methods to -omics data primarily under the direction of the collaborative project team 
o    Develop multiple “specialty” analytical areas that serve one or more collaborative teams
o    Create flexible and scalable project-based R Shiny applications 
o    Lead adoption of best practices in specialty analytical or biomedical areas by the bioinformatics group and peers
Collaboration (20%): Lead bioinformatics portion of scientific collaborations as the primary bioinformatics resource
o    As bioinformatics point, assume management role for projects of low-to-moderate complexity, including all aspects of timelines, risk identification and mitigation strategies, and communication mechanisms
o    Directly manage all elements of project satisfaction and performance relative to scientific project aims
o    Promote continual objective, “hard” discussions about overall health of project and relationship
o    Develop new collaborations with moderate degree of supervision
Academic Output (10%): Lead project-based presentations, grant sections, and manuscript sections with subsequent review by peers and mentors
o    Regularly contribute to manuscripts, conference posters, and/or platform presentations
o    Proactively contribute to bioinformatics and other sections of grant and award proposals
