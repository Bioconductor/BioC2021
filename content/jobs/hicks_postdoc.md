#### Description

Dr. Stephanie Hicks (https://www.stephaniehicks.com) is seeking to hire a postdoctoral fellow in genomic data science to join her research group at Johns Hopkins. This postdoctoral fellow will have the flexibility to pursue projects broadly at the intersection of Dr. Hicks’s ongoing research areas: developing fast and scalable statistical methods and open-source software to help researchers solve open problems in genomics, including data with spatial resolution or at the single-cell (or single-nucleus) level. This is highly relevant to public health as these methods and software will enable emerging genomic technologies to become primary tools for translational research and clinical applications for human health.

The research group of Dr. Hicks works towards solving scientific problems through collaboration and team science. Key emphasis is also on open science, rigor and reproducibility, and curiosity in the scientific problem. Every member of Dr. Hicks’s research group is human first and is treated as such — with kindness and respect. Dr. Hicks is a faculty member of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab, and Co-founder of R-Ladies Baltimore, a local chapter of a global organization to increase gender diversity in the R programming community. She is committed to increasing justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion in the mathematical, statistical and genomic data sciences. 

Strong mentorship and personalized training to achieve the postdoctoral fellow’s unique long-term career goals will be provided. In addition, the postdoctoral fellow will have the opportunity to engage in scientific and professional development including presenting their work at local and national conferences, mentoring students, and participating in coursework or teaching, if they so choose. The postdoctoral fellow will join the large, vibrant community of genomics research happening at Johns Hopkins and surrounding institutions, including close collaborations with researchers at the Lieber Institute for Brain Development.

#### Qualifications
