#### Description

At Bristol Myers Squibb, we are inspired by a single vision – transforming patients’ lives through science. In oncology, hematology, immunology and cardiovascular disease – and one of the most diverse and promising pipelines in the industry – each of our passionate colleagues contribute to innovations that drive meaningful change. We bring a human touch to every treatment we pioneer. Join us and make a difference.

Position Summary

We seek a collaborative and innovative computational scientist to join the Predictive Sciences team in San Diego and bring razor-sharp predictive research and informatics skills and acute scientific acumen to bear on our next-generation protein degradation assays and AI/ML prediction platforms.

Working alongside Research & Early Development colleagues in the BMS Oncogenesis Thematic Research Center, Small Molecular Drug Discovery, and teams in the global Informatics and Predictive Sciences (IPS) department, the successful applicant will play a key scientific role in systemic integration and use of state-of-art proteomics and other biochemical and cellular assay systems to empower burgeoning AI/ML applications in protein degradation drug discovery research. This role offers the opportunity to directly impact the origination and development of transformational therapies in key diseases of unmet medical need. Strong interest in the interdisciplinary application of computational research to the life sciences is imperative.
