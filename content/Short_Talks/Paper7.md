#### Abstract

R is unparalleled in its ability to transform raw data into a wide array of beautiful graphics, all within the same environment. However, when it comes to complex, multi-paneled plots, users rely on 3rd party graphic design software to arrange and customize plots. Here we present BentoBox, a coordinate-based genomic data visualization package that will revolutionize multi-figure plotting in R. Employing grid Graphics and drawing from the paradigms of base plotting and ggplot2, BentoBox offers precise, programmatic control over the placement, aesthetics, and arrangements of plots through a user-defined page with explicit units of measurement. Its edge-to-edge, containerized visualizations preserve the mapping between user-specified containers and the represented data, ensuring accurate alignment of plots in the same genomic region. Operating entirely within the R environment, BentoBox is optimized to quickly and easily read, plot, and arrange multi-omic data for an endless number of use cases. Come join us in changing how we plot in R!
