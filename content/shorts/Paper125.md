#### Abstract

While radiation therapy is an integral method for cancer treatment, clinical choices are not currently informed by the genetic and molecular profile of a patient’s tumour. Though it has been shown that genetic features implicate variability, the exact relationship between these features and radiosensitivity is poorly understood. We introduce RadioGx, a package to unify radiosensitivity data and molecular profiles of cancer cell lines to identify features predictive of sensitivity to radiation. RadioGx models dose-response data using the linear-quadratic model for radiotherapy, and integrates transcriptomic data to determine pathway- and tissue-specific determinants of radioresponse. To demonstrate the utility of RadioGx, we explore a case study on a dataset from the Cleveland Clinic and use pathway-level transcriptomic modeling methods to identify transcriptional programs associated with radiation sensitivity. Our pancancer model achieves a Pearson’s correlation of 0.47 (p<0.001) with measured radiosensitivity using only high level transcriptomic features. These results implicate cellular processes in radiosensitivity and demonstrate a method to identify features associated with radiosensitivity through integration of large scale datasets. RadioGx is a computational tool for hypothesis generation to advance preclinical research for radiation oncology and precision medicine.
