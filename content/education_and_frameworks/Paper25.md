#### Abstract

Bioinformatics has grown in adoption in many non-technical fields, advancing so rapidly that traditional bench scientists are finding it challenging to keep up with gold standard workflows. Complex bioinformatics data analyses become difficult to retain when learned using traditional teaching methods or static formats, which are often not updated or available for feedback. As a continuously maintained R package, BiocSwirl makes learning bioinformatics concepts hands-on through modular, self-paced, interactive course material targeted at beginners. Our courses communicate a wide range of concepts, from first steps in R and data science to high-level analyses and visualizations of biological datasets from within the R console. BiocSwirl’s primary feature is the ability to provide real-time feedback on the user’s R syntax that promotes good coding practices, open science, and reproducibility in students. Our currently available curriculum includes introductions to RNAseq, scRNAseq, ChIPseq, and Biostatistics as well as a “Data Science for Life Scientists” course. Ultimately, BiocSwirl removes the barrier to entry into R Data Science in bioinformatics while instilling a foundation of open science practices for students and researchers.
