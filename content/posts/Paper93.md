#### Abstract

Omics Playground is a user-friendly and interactive self-service bioinformatics platform for the in-depth analysis, visualisation and interpretation of transcriptomics and proteomics data. It is implemented in R using the Shiny web application framework and provides access to a large number of bioconductor modules that include data quality checks, clustering analysis, standard pairwise comparisons, gene set enrichment analysis and biomarker discovery among others. The platform also contains several modules dedicated to single cell RNA-seq data analysis. Furthermore, it intersects the outputs of several differential expression and geneset enrichment analysis algorithms, that can be chosen by the users, to provide more reliable and significant hits. Users can also include their own datasets in the platform to build customised databases for comparative analysis.
The platform is constantly updated to reflect the latest advancements and an open-access version is currently available as a cloud-based service (https://public.bigomics.ch/). A special edition focused on viral infections is also available on the web  in response to the Covid-19 pandemic (https://covid19.bigomics.ch/).
