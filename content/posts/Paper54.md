## Rsubread: mapping and quantification of RNA-seq data

#### Abstract

Rsubread is a popular Bioconductor package that was developed for mapping RNA-seq reads and then counting the reads to genomic features including genes and exons. It also includes a recently developed new function, called CellCounts, for quantifying scRNA-seq data generated by the 10X Chromium platform. In this talk, I will describe the algorithms implemented in the mapping and counting functions in Rsubread and present the results of comparing to competing tools, including the CellRanger program developed by 10X for the quantification of their single-cell data.
