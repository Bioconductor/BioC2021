## Opportunities for modular genomic overlap enrichment and annotation search and retrieval

#### Abstract

There are a number of well-developed and easy-to-use packages in Bioconductor for overlap enrichment analysis, i.e. the "surprise" at seeing a degree of overlap of two genomic feature sets. This birds-of-a-feather session is designed to assess opportunities for connections or modular package and function development across these existing frameworks. We will also discuss ways to enhance or more easily connect existing packages to annotated feature sets using frameworks such as AnnotationHub.
