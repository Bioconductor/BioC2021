## Benchmarking RNA-Seq Deconvolution Methods

#### Abstract

In bulk RNA-Seq experiments, investigators often do not have complete information regarding the composition of tissues that are to be sequenced. However, the expression of unique genes can completely characterize the specific functions of different cell types. As such, estimating tissue composition can be a crucial step in many high-throughput experiments. Deconvolution methods have become a popular area of research intended to estimate tissue composition when it is unknown. Over the past decade, several methods have been developed which tackle the deconvolution problem in different ways. In this poster, we perform a benchmark analysis of existing deconvolution methods and summarize their respective performance. In particular, we focus on the comparison between reference-based and reference-free methods.
