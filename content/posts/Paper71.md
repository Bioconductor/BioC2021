#### Abstract

Studies have shown that radiomic features are sensitive to the variability of imaging parameters (e.g., scanner model) and one of the major challenges in these studies lies in improving the robustness of quantitative features against the variations in imaging datasets from multi-center studies. Here, we assess the impact of inter scanner variability on the computed tomography (CT)-derived radiomic features to predict association of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma with human papillomavirus (HPV). This experiment was performed on CT image datasets acquired with two different scanner manufacturers. We demonstrate strong scanner dependency by developing a machine learning model to classify HPV status from radiological images. These experiments revealed the effect of inter scanner variability on the robustness of the radiomic features, and the extent of this dependency is reflected on the performance of HPV prediction models. The results of this study highlight the importance of implementing an appropriate  approach to reduce the impact of imaging parameters on radiomic features and consequently on the machine learning models
