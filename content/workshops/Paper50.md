## Effectively using the DelayedArray framework to support the analysis of large datasets

Peter Hickey

_Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research_

#### Abstract

This workshop gives an introductory overview of the DelayedArray framework, which can be used by R / Bioconductor packages to support the analysis of large array-like datasets. A DelayedArray is like an ordinary array in R, but allows for the data to be in-memory, on-disk in a file, or even hosted on a remote server.

Workshop participants will learn where they might encounter a DelayedArray in the wild while using Bioconductor and understand the fundamental concepts underlying the DelayedArray framework. This workshop will feature introductory material, ‘live’ coding, and Q&A, all of which are adapted from the content below.

This is a repeat of my BioC 2020 virtual workshop. I plan to revise the written material but re-use the video recording as-is.

**Keywords:** DelayedArray, HDF5Array, DelayedMatrixStats
