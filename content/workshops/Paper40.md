## Multi-omic Integration of cBioPortal and TCGA data with MultiAssayExperiment

Marcel Ramos, Levi Waldron, Ludwig Geistlinger

_CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy_

#### Abstract

This workshop demonstrates the leveraging of public multi-omics databases, such
as cBioPortal and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), through an overview of the
`cBioPortalData` and `curatedTCGAData` experiment data packages. It
introduces users to minimal data management with `MultiAssayExperiment` and
`TCGAutils`, packages that organize and manage multi-omics datasets. The
workshop aims to improve the ease-of-use of TCGA data, and introduce
participants to common Bioconductor data structures including
`SummarizedExperiment`, `MultiAssayExperiment` and `RaggedExperiment`. The
workshop will also mention soon-to-be-released updates to
`MultiAssayExperiment` such as renaming primary identifiers, column names,
splitting assays, and `maftools` compatibility.

**Keywords:** Data Representation, Infrastructure, cBioPortal, MultiOmic Integration
